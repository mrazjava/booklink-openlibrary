# Each row number in this filter will cause import to exclude the record 
# from processing. Each line must be numeric. First row index = 1.
#
# This filter is useful for filtering out bad rows posted by openlibrary.org, 
# or just in general to skip certain records.

# This filter can be applied to any import type (author, works, edition)
